# Sentimental-Analysis-Using-NLTK-and-Transformers

Overview
This project implements Sentimental Analysis to classify text into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models.

Features
Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings

Training and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models)

Visualization of results and insights
